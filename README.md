## OOP Concepts Used

This project utilizes several key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts:

- **Encapsulation**: The data in our classes is hidden from other classes, and can be accessed through methods.
- **Inheritance**: We have used inheritance to promote code reuse and create a natural and clear structure for our code.
- **Polymorphism**: Our classes have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters, and child classes have their own unique implementations of methods inherited from their parent class.
- **Abstraction**: We have used interfaces and abstract classes to hide the complexity of certain operations and expose only the relevant details to the user.

## Test Cases

Added unit tests for all the major functionalities of our application. These tests ensure that the code behaves as expected when it interacts with other parts of the system. We have used the JUnit testing framework for writing and running our tests.

To run the tests, use the following command in the terminal:

```bash
mvn test
